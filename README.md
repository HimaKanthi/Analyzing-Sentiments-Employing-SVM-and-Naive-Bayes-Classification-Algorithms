# Sentimental-Analysis-Using-SVM-and-Naive-Bayes-Classification-Algorithms
* Performed data collection by scrapping 10,000+ customer reviews for Amazon products.
* Pre-processed the data by standardizing location information, Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) feature extraction.
* Ensured data consistency through sanity checks – removed typo mistakes using spell check module and google translator for multi-language processing.
* Built word clouds and performed sentiment analysis using SentimentIntensityAnalyzer in the VaderSentiment class. 
* Improved F1 score from 81% to 90.25% by building and training SVM and Naïve Bayes machine learning models to classify reviews into positive and negative groups.
